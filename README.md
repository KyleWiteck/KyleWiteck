# Hey â€” I'm Kyle Witeck

I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer with a focus on scalable UI architecture, strong developer experience, and clean, performant code. I specialize in React + TypeScript, and I'm currently building a SaaS product solo â€” from auth and subscriptions to UI and billing.

I donâ€™t work on flashy side projects or code for fun. I care about solving real problems, shipping smart solutions, and building things that make sense.

## ðŸ§  What I Do Well

- Front-End Architecture & Design Systems
- React, TypeScript, Vite, Vanilla Extract
- Performance optimization & accessibility
- UI component libraries built for maintainability
- Building SaaS from scratch (auth, billing, permissions, DX)
