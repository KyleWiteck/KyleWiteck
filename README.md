# Hey — I'm Kyle Witeck

I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer with a focus on scalable UI architecture, strong developer experience, and clean, performant code. I specialize in React + TypeScript, and I'm currently building a SaaS product solo — from auth and subscriptions to UI and billing.

I don’t work on flashy side projects or code for fun. I care about solving real problems, shipping smart solutions, and building things that make sense.

## 🧠 What I Do Well

- Front-End Architecture & Design Systems
- React, TypeScript, Vite, Vanilla Extract
- Performance optimization & accessibility
- UI component libraries built for maintainability
- Building SaaS from scratch (auth, billing, permissions, DX)

## 🚧 Currently Working On

Building a B2B SaaS product part-time — focused on solid architecture, clean UX, and a smooth user onboarding flow. Foundation first, features later.

## 🎯 Career Goals

- Front-End Architect track
- Remote-only roles ($175k+)
- Financial freedom through software & real estate

> I don't want a flashy portfolio. I want to build things that give people time back and let me do the same.
